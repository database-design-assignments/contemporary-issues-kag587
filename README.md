# Contemporary Issues In Data  
In this assignment, I have gathered two articles that discuss subjects that are data-related. I have placed the links to these articles in this document, as well as my interpretation of the readings.   
## Facebook Data  
This CNN article, titled [_Is your data safe on Facebook? Not really_](https://github.com/database-design-assignments/contemporary-issues-kag587/blob/main/instructions.md) , talks about the way Facebook uses user's data. This articles discusses how Facebook uses user's data to advertise to them. Companys buy this data off of Facebook so that they can more accurately advertise products and services to Facebook's users based on demographic and ineterests.
>" On Facebook, you are the product. Advertisers are the customer."  

Sites like Facebook allow other companies to buy access to their user's data. This is why Facebook is still free for users. They make all of their money through outside advertising.  

Users on Facebook consent to their data being used for these purposes when they sign up for the site. 
> "Giving up our privacy is the price we pay for getting to use Facebook for free".  

Facebook is not alone in this method. Google also captures data on your searches and interests to sirect adverising. There are ways to change data privacy settings, but these companies make it very difficult. 
  
## Facebook's Take on Apple's New Privacy Policy  
In this article written in the Harvard Business Review, the author reviews Facebooks claims about the new privacy policy in use at apple. The article, titled [_Facebook’s Misleading Campaign Against Apple’s Privacy Policy_](https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy), The authors mention that the new Apple privacy policy requires users to "opt in" if they want to allow their data to be tracked and used for advertising. Apple states that businesses and apps will have to explain how they plan to use data upon submission to Apple. Apple expects many users will not agree to their data bein used. Facebook claims that this will hurt small businesses especially in the midst of the pandemic. Facebook claims that some small buisnesses will lose 60% of their sails for every dollar they spend on advertising.  

Facebook measuers success metrics such as this in, whish is retuen on revenue spending, which is returns on spending associated with advertisements. Harvard Business Review saw some potential flaw in that logic, so they looked into the study that Facebook claimes to use to discover these numbers. Facebook based their rearsearch off of [The Deloitte Study](https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy), which is a small and medium business report. Harvard discovered that Facebook reported the higher end of the outliers in their statement and that the average business would not see those types of numbers.
